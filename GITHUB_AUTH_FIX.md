# Alternative: Upload to GitHub via Web Interface

Since we're having authentication issues with git push, here's an alternative method:

## Option 1: Fix Git Authentication (Recommended for long-term)

### Create a Personal Access Token:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "JolashSalonm Deploy"
4. Select scopes:
   - ✅ repo (all)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)

### Use the token to push:

```powershell
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/Phillipjr9/JolashSalonm.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with the token you copied.

## Option 2: Use GitHub Desktop (Easier)

1. Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Install and sign in
3. File → Add Local Repository
4. Choose: C:\Users\USER\Documents\GitHub\JolashSalonm
5. Click "Publish repository"
6. Done!

---

## Option 3: Manual Upload (Quick but tedious)

1. Go to: https://github.com/Phillipjr9/JolashSalonm
2. Click "uploading an existing file"
3. Drag all your project files (except node_modules and .git)
4. Commit

**Not recommended** - too many files to upload manually.

## What I Recommend:

**Use Option 1 (Personal Access Token)** - it's the most professional way and works with deployment platforms.

Let me know which option you'd like to use!
