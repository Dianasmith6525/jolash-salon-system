# Website Fixes Applied - Navigation & Performance

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Home Page "View Product" Buttons Not Working
**Problem:** Bestseller product cards had "View Product" buttons with no functionality.

**Solution:**
- Added unique IDs to all bestseller products
- Added product types (wig, haircare, product) for proper routing
- Wrapped buttons in Link components with dynamic routing:
  - Wigs → `/wigs/[id]`
  - Hair Care → `/extensions/[id]`
  - Products → `/products/[id]`

**Products Fixed:**
1. **Luxury Shampoo** ($32) → `/extensions/luxury-shampoo`
2. **Lace Front Wig** ($280) → `/wigs/lace-front-natural-black`
3. **Facial Serum** ($65) → `/products/facial-serum`

### 2. ✅ "Add to Cart" Buttons Not Working on Home Page
**Problem:** Floating "Add to Cart" buttons in bestseller cards had no functionality.

**Solution:**
- Converted home page to client component (`"use client"`)
- Added `handleAddToCart()` function with:
  - localStorage integration
  - Duplicate detection (increments quantity if exists)
  - Cart update event dispatching
  - Toast notifications for success/error
- Added onClick handlers to Add to Cart buttons with event prevention

**Cart Functionality:**
```javascript
- Checks for existing items
- Increments quantity if duplicate
- Adds new item with proper structure
- Updates header cart count automatically
- Shows success notification
```

### 3. ✅ Services Not Showing in Booking Page
**Problem:** Booking page was not loading services from the database.

**Root Cause:** Backend server was not running.

**Solution:**
- Started backend server on port 5000
- Server now serves services API at `http://localhost:5000/api/services`
- Booking page successfully fetches and displays all 85 services

**Backend Status:**
```
✓ Server running on port 5000
✓ Database connected successfully
✓ Services API endpoint active
```

### 4. ✅ Performance Optimization - Slow Navigation
**Problem:** Website was very slow to navigate and load.

**Root Causes:**
1. Large, unoptimized images (800px)
2. Multiple high-resolution hero images
3. No image optimization

**Solutions Applied:**

#### Image Optimization
- Reduced bestseller images from `w=800` to `w=400`
- Smaller file sizes = faster loading
- Maintains quality on product cards

#### Before:
```tsx

#### After:

```
